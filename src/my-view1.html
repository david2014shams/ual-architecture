        The goal is to narrow the gap between the two. So, please pay special attention to things that may look small changes – which are really not small at all and will have enormous impact on your code maintainability, scalability and debugability ( yes, I just made up that term ).
      <p>As you all know, under the hood every code that you write is just zeros and ones <code>01010101010101010101010</code>.

        So, why have we moved away from writing computer programs in zeros and ones?

      <p>There are small deviations from the way you may be writing code and architecting your solutions, which may have a large impact on the future of code maintainability, reusability, scalability and ease of understanding.
