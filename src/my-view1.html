      <p>        Ask 10 developers to write a piece of code and you will get 10 different codes. Each developer will relegiously defend his or her way of coding.
      <div class="do">Some ways of writing code does work in real life - <code>DISIGN PATTERNS</code></div>
      <div class="dont">Some way of writing code does NOT works in real life - <code>ANTI PATTERNS</code></div>

      <h3>Symptoms of <code>ANTI PATTERNS</code>:</h3>

        Getting things working and done is one thing, and getting things done properly and making them work it totally different thing.
        <br>
        The goal is to narrow the gap between the two. So, please pay special attention to things that may look small changes – which are really not small at all and will have enormous impact on your code maintainability, scalability and debugability ( yes, I just made up that term ).
      <p>As you all know, under the hood every code that you write is just zeros and ones <code>01010101010101010101010</code>.

        So, why have we moved away from writing computer programs in zeros and ones?

      <p>      Computer Scientists spent life-time of their careers to come up with <code>best practices</code>, <code>design patterns</code> and <code>architectures</code>.

      <p>There are small deviations from the way you may be writing code and architecting your solutions, which may have a large impact on the future of code maintainability, reusability, scalability and ease of understanding.
