        There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things.

      <p>
        Getting things working and done is one thing, and getting things done properly and making them work it totally different thing.
        <br>
      The goal is to narrow the gap between the two. So, please pay special attention to things that may look small changes – which are really not small at all and will have enormous impact on your code maintainability, scalability and debugability ( yes, I just made up that term ).
      <p>As you all know, under the hood every code that you write is the same zeros and ones <code>01010101010101010101010</code>.

      So, why have we moved away from writing computer programs in zeros and ones?

    </p>
      Because, they are
      <ul class="square" type="square">
        <li><span>hard to understand</span></li>
        <li><span>hard to maintain</span></li>
        <li><span>hard to scale</span></li>
        <li><span>hard to debug</span></li>
      </ul>

      Computer Scientists spent life-time of their careers to come up with <code>best practices</code>, <code>design patterns</code> and <code>architectures</code>.

      There are small deviations from the way you may be writing code and architecting your solutions, which may have a large impact on the future of code maintainability, reusability, scalability and ease of understanding.

      <div class="emphasize">In programming small change may not be so small at all !</div>
